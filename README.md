# Title
Weather Data Visualisation

## Explanation
In this task, you're tasked with creating a weather data visualization app that fetches weather information from OpenWeatherMap and displays corresponding images from Unsplash. The app should allow users to input a city and see the current weather along with matching images.



### Example Result

Given the input "London", the app should display the current weather conditions in London along with images matching the weather description, such as sunny skies, rainy days, or snowy landscapes.

## Prior Knowledge

To complete this task, students should have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They should know how to work with APIs, make fetch requests, and handle JSON data. Additionally, familiarity with event handling and DOM manipulation will be helpful in building the interactive features of the app.

## Advanced Challenges

1.Implement autocomplete functionality for the city input field, fetching city suggestions from a separate API.
2.Add a feature to display a 5-day weather forecast for the selected city.
3.Enhance the UI by adding animations or transitions when loading weather data and images.
4.Implement a feature to allow users to save their favorite cities and view weather information for multiple locations simultaneously.
5.Incorporate geolocation to automatically detect and display weather information for the user's current location.
